ASP.NET mini course project about local neighbourhood events near you. Where you can help with the organisation of the chosen event as a volunteer. </br>
The point of creating this project was not to make something that is never created. It was to show some of my skills as using good practices to write quality code, understanding SOLID principals, working with CRUD operations, readability, sustainability. ✨</br>
## I used MVC architecture within four folders 📁:
- Common (global validation constants)
- Data (DbContext, Database Configuratios, Migrations, Data Models and Interfaces for them)
- Services (Services for the actions in the Controllers and Interfaces for them)
- Web (Views, View Models, Identity, Application settings and Controllers)
### Other used technologies were 👨‍💻:
- ASP.NET framework
- Entity Framework
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- HTML & CSS
